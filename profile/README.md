We are the [Chair of Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/) at [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/). The chair is conducting research in the field of Machine Learning and Data-Science methods and their applications to large datasets. We work on understanding socio-economic systems and modeling human social and economic behavior using computational methods and new kinds of data.
